# SeqAlignment
A program that aligns two sequences using the Needleman-Wunsch alignment algorithm

The program requires a text file input that contains the two sequences that are to be aligned, with the first sequence on the first line and the second sequence on the following newline.

Additionally, the gap penalty on the similarity matrix score can be adjusted using the -d flag followed by a negative integer denoting the desired gap penalty (default = -1).

This is my first script project resembling anything remotely close to bioninformatic.
